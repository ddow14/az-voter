            <p>      The pie displays the imbalance of the party registration in each congressional district.
              It is the ratio of Republican to Democrat registrations in each district. A score of 1 is parity,
              a score less than 1 means there are more Democrats than Republicans. A score greater than 1 means there are more Democrats.
